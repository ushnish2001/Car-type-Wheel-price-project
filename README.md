# Car-type-Wheel-price-project

This projects briefly discusses about the different prices about the wheel on the basis of car type not the model.

1. We first start by importing various libraries like pandas and numpy.

2. Since we need to use graphs we require seaborn and matplotlib hence we import them too.

3. We present our entire data and classify them accordingly.

4. We provide different ttributes to group relevant data required by our data.

5. Next plotting the graph using seaborn between engine size and price.

6. Similarly for highway mileage and price we plot , classify and group the data

7. Next comes peak rpm and price plotting with table alongwith stroke-price variations.

8. We make a boxplot for all the above attributes and make a graph accordingly

9. We filter and furnish our data on the basis on wheel-drive like AWD,4WD,FWD,RWD

10. We now group by the following cars using engine location attribute and detect the price.

11. Finally we get a solid output like a table data basedon the the wheel drive, car type and the price.

12. Now we import matplotlib in the picture and group colours for different types of attributes and prices.

13. Lastly we import stats from scipy and find Pearson Correlation Coefficient and ANOVA results which states the changes in our car price with the given attriutes like Body type, rpm, etc.
